                <p><span class="bold">Background</span>: In this case, the accused, Madhkar Narayan Mardikar, was a
                    doctor
                    who performed a medical
                    termination of pregnancy (abortion) on a woman without her consent. The prosecution argued that the
                    doctor violated Section 312 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with causing a miscarriage
                    without the woman's consent. </p>

                <p><span class="bold mt-4">Legal Issue</span>: The key legal issue in this case was whether the accused
                    could be
                    held liable under Section
                    312 of the IPC for performing an abortion without the woman's consent.</p>

                <p><span class="bold mt-4">Decision</span>: The Bombay High Court held that the doctor was indeed guilty
                    under
                    Section 312. The court
                    emphasized that the term "consent" under Section 312 includes informed consent, and in this case,
                    the
                    doctor failed to obtain the woman's informed consent before performing the abortion. The court
                    highlighted the importance of a woman's autonomy over her body and the necessity of obtaining clear
                    and
                    voluntary consent before medical procedures like abortions.</p>

                <p><span class="bold mt-4">Significance</span>: This case is significant as it establishes the
                    importance
                    of
                    informed consent in medical
                    procedures, particularly in the context of abortions. It reinforces the legal principle that medical
                    practitioners must respect the autonomy and rights of patients, ensuring that they are fully
                    informed
                    and provide consent willingly before undergoing any medical procedure.</p>
