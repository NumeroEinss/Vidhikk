            <p>
              <span class="bold">Background</span>: In this case, the accused,
              Madhkar Narayan Mardikar, was a doctor who performed a medical
              termination of pregnancy (abortion) on a woman without her
              consent. The prosecution argued that the doctor violated Section
              312 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with causing a
              miscarriage without the woman's consent.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="bold mt-4">Legal Issue</span>: The key legal issue in
              this case was whether the accused could be held liable under
              Section 312 of the IPC for performing an abortion without the
              woman's consent.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="bold mt-4">Decision</span>: The Bombay High Court
              held that the doctor was indeed guilty under Section 312. The
              court emphasized that the term "consent" under Section 312
              includes informed consent, and in this case, the doctor failed to
              obtain the woman's informed consent before performing the
              abortion. The court highlighted the importance of a woman's
              autonomy over her body and the necessity of obtaining clear and
              voluntary consent before medical procedures like abortions.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="bold mt-4">Significance</span>: This case is
              significant as it establishes the importance of informed consent
              in medical procedures, particularly in the context of abortions.
              It reinforces the legal principle that medical practitioners must
              respect the autonomy and rights of patients, ensuring that they
              are fully informed and provide consent willingly before undergoing
              any medical procedure.
